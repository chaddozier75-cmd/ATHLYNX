# DHG Leadership Principles
## Inspired by Amazon's Model - Adapted for Dozier Holdings Group

### The Bezos Model Applied to Sports & Athletes

Amazon's 16 Leadership Principles adapted for the ATHLYNX / DHG Empire:

---

## 1. ATHLETE OBSESSION (Customer Obsession)
Leaders start with the athlete and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep athlete trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over athletes.

**DHG Version:** "Every decision starts with: How does this help the athlete succeed?"

---

## 2. OWNERSHIP
Leaders are owners. They think long term and don't sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say "that's not my job."

**DHG Version:** "We own our outcomes. No excuses. No finger-pointing."

---

## 3. INVENT AND SIMPLIFY
Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify.

**DHG Version:** "If it's complicated, we haven't finished building it yet."

---

## 4. ARE RIGHT, A LOT
Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.

**DHG Version:** "Trust the data. Trust the process. But always verify."

---

## 5. LEARN AND BE CURIOUS
Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves.

**DHG Version:** "Stay hungry. Stay curious. The game is always evolving."

---

## 6. HIRE AND DEVELOP THE BEST
Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion.

**DHG Version:** "A players hire A players. B players hire C players."

---

## 7. INSIST ON THE HIGHEST STANDARDS
Leaders have relentlessly high standards—many people may think these standards are unreasonably high.

**DHG Version:** "Good enough isn't. Championship standards only."

---

## 8. THINK BIG
Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results.

**DHG Version:** "We're not building an app. We're building an empire."

---

## 9. BIAS FOR ACTION
Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.

**DHG Version:** "Move fast. Break things. Fix them faster."

---

## 10. FRUGALITY
Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency and invention.

**DHG Version:** "Every dollar matters until we're profitable. Then every dollar still matters."

---

## 11. EARN TRUST
Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully.

**DHG Version:** "Trust is earned in drops and lost in buckets."

---

## 12. DIVE DEEP
Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently.

**DHG Version:** "Know your numbers. Know your product. Know your athlete."

---

## 13. HAVE BACKBONE; DISAGREE AND COMMIT
Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable.

**DHG Version:** "Speak up in the room. Commit outside of it."

---

## 14. DELIVER RESULTS
Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion.

**DHG Version:** "All the hard work means nothing without the close. The deal has to get done—that's when we get paid."

---

## 15. STRIVE TO BE THE BEST EMPLOYER
Leaders work every day to create a safer, more productive, higher performing work environment.

**DHG Version:** "Take care of your people. They'll take care of the business."

---

## 16. SUCCESS AND SCALE BRING BROAD RESPONSIBILITY
We are big, we impact the world, and we are far from perfect. We must be humble and thoughtful.

**DHG Version:** "With great platform comes great responsibility. Use it wisely."
